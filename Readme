An ecommerce site is a website that enables businesses to sell products or services to customers online. It allows customers to browse and purchase products or services directly from the website, with payments typically made online via various payment options such as credit card, debit card, net banking, or digital wallets. Ecommerce sites may offer a wide range of products from different brands or specialize in a specific niche, such as fashion, electronics, or home goods. These sites often have search and filtering functions to help customers find what they are looking for quickly, and may offer features such as product reviews, ratings, and recommendations to aid in the decision-making process. Ecommerce sites may also offer additional services such as order tracking, returns and exchanges, and customer support to enhance the shopping experience.
